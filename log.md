# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 30, 2020 
**Today's Progress**: Studied CSS and some design styles. Specifically neumorphic designs. Made a simple app to showcase this style on a button. 

**Thoughts:** I enjoyed taking a peek into the world of web design. I solidified some CSS concepts I was unsure about. Still a lot of work to do.

### Day 2: July 1, 2020 
**Today's Progress**: I started working on a calculator app using React. I styled it with the Neu styles I practiced yesterday. 

**Thoughts:** Calculators are harder to wire up in the back end than I previously thought. I'll finish the UX tomorrow and hopefully get through some of the back end.

### Day 3: July 2, 2020 
**Today's Progress**: I finalized the design for the calculator app. 

**Thoughts:** I'm glad I finished the design of the app and I like how it looks. But tomorrow, I'm going to start a more simple day project to get used to React Hooks a bit more, and then return to finishing this app. I want to feel more confident before jumping into more advanced concepts.

### Day 4: July 3, 2020 
**Today's Progress**: I made a simple to do app using React Hooks.  

**Thoughts:** This was a good project for me. It taught me more about React Hooks and I feel more confident.

### Day 5: July 4, 2020 
**Today's Progress**: I made a US Flag using React and CSS. 

**Thoughts:** This was a fun little project. It taught me more about how .map works, and when and how you should loop in React.

### Day 6-7: July 5-6, 2020 
**Today's Progress**: I went on a roadtrip and learned more about flexbox. 

**Thoughts:** I really needed this time to learn about flexbox. I can't wait to be able to move things around the page just as I please. I'm going to practice these concepts tomorrow. 

### Day 8: July 7, 2020 
**Today's Progress**: I made progress with Flexbox and practiced its concepts with the online exercise (Flexbox Froggy), and by making custom navbars. 

**Thoughts:** Flexbox is very important to placing components on a page. I feel a little more confident in coding now!

### Day 9: July 8, 2020 
**Today's Progress**: I looked into designs for web developer portfolio pages. I began my own by writing the code for the header and the main quote on the page.  

**Thoughts:** It's a bit daunting taking on a whole website, but I enjoy coming up with color palettes and applying them to my site. Lots of work to do.

### Day 10-11: July 9-10, 2020 
**Today's Progress**: I spent these two days focusing on the box model, and Flexbox. 

**Thoughts:** This site it pretty simple so far, but it's helping me comprehend the basics better. I am shooting to have it finished by early next week.

### Day 12: July 11, 2020 
**Today's Progress**: Today I coded the bare bones for my 'About' section. 

**Thoughts:** So far I'm on schedule to finish on time. There will be lots of work to do tomorrow, but I'm optimistic. The things that take me the most time are deciding on design aspects throughout the site.
