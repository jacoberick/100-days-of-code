# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 30, 2020 
**Today's Progress**: Studied CSS and some design styles. Specifically neumorphic designs. Made a simple app to showcase this style on a button. 

**Thoughts:** I enjoyed taking a peek into the world of web design. I solidified some CSS concepts I was unsure about. Still a lot of work to do.

### Day 2: July 1, 2020 
**Today's Progress**: I started working on a calculator app using React. I styled it with the Neu styles I practiced yesterday. 

**Thoughts:** Calculators are harder to wire up in the back end than I previously thought. I'll finish the UX tomorrow and hopefully get through some of the back end.
