# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 30, 2020 
**Today's Progress**: Studied CSS and some design styles. Specifically neumorphic designs. Made a simple app to showcase this style on a button. 

**Thoughts:** I enjoyed taking a peek into the world of web design. I solidified some CSS concepts I was unsure about. Still a lot of work to do.

### Day 2: July 1, 2020 
**Today's Progress**: I started working on a calculator app using React. I styled it with the Neu styles I practiced yesterday. 

**Thoughts:** Calculators are harder to wire up in the back end than I previously thought. I'll finish the UX tomorrow and hopefully get through some of the back end.

### Day 3: July 2, 2020 
**Today's Progress**: I finalized the design for the calculator app. 

**Thoughts:** I'm glad I finished the design of the app and I like how it looks. But tomorrow, I'm going to start a more simple day project to get used to React Hooks a bit more, and then return to finishing this app. I want to feel more confident before jumping into more advanced concepts.

### Day 4: July 3, 2020 
**Today's Progress**: I made a simple to do app using React Hooks.  

**Thoughts:** This was a good project for me. It taught me more about React Hooks and I feel more confident.

### Day 5: July 4, 2020 
**Today's Progress**: I made a US Flag using React and CSS. 

**Thoughts:** This was a fun little project. It taught me more about how .map works, and when and how you should loop in React.

### Day 6-7: July 5-6, 2020 
**Today's Progress**: I went on a roadtrip and learned more about flexbox. 

**Thoughts:** I really needed this time to learn about flexbox. I can't wait to be able to move things around the page just as I please. I'm going to practice these concepts tomorrow. 

### Day 8: July 7, 2020 
**Today's Progress**: I made progress with Flexbox and practiced its concepts with the online exercise (Flexbox Froggy), and by making custom navbars. 

**Thoughts:** Flexbox is very important to placing components on a page. I feel a little more confident in coding now!

### Day 9: July 8, 2020 
**Today's Progress**: I looked into designs for web developer portfolio pages. I began my own by writing the code for the header and the main quote on the page.  

**Thoughts:** It's a bit daunting taking on a whole website, but I enjoy coming up with color palettes and applying them to my site. Lots of work to do.

### Day 10-11: July 9-10, 2020 
**Today's Progress**: I spent these two days focusing on the box model, and Flexbox. 

**Thoughts:** This site it pretty simple so far, but it's helping me comprehend the basics better. I am shooting to have it finished by early next week.
