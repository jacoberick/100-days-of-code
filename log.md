# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 30, 2020 
**Today's Progress**: Studied CSS and some design styles. Specifically neumorphic designs. Made a simple app to showcase this style on a button. 

**Thoughts:** I enjoyed taking a peek into the world of web design. I solidified some CSS concepts I was unsure about. Still a lot of work to do.

### Day 2: July 1, 2020 
**Today's Progress**: I started working on a calculator app using React. I styled it with the Neu styles I practiced yesterday. 

**Thoughts:** Calculators are harder to wire up in the back end than I previously thought. I'll finish the UX tomorrow and hopefully get through some of the back end.

### Day 3: July 2, 2020 
**Today's Progress**: I finalized the design for the calculator app. 

**Thoughts:** I'm glad I finished the design of the app and I like how it looks. But tomorrow, I'm going to start a more simple day project to get used to React Hooks a bit more, and then return to finishing this app. I want to feel more confident before jumping into more advanced concepts.

### Day 4: July 3, 2020 
**Today's Progress**: I made a simple to do app using React Hooks.  

**Thoughts:** This was a good project for me. It taught me more about React Hooks and I feel more confident.

### Day 5: July 4, 2020 
**Today's Progress**: I made a US Flag using React and CSS. 

**Thoughts:** This was a fun little project. It taught me more about how .map works, and when and how you should loop in React.

### Day 6-7: July 5-6, 2020 
**Today's Progress**: I went on a roadtrip and learned more about flexbox. 

**Thoughts:** I really needed this time to learn about flexbox. I can't wait to be able to move things around the page just as I please. I'm going to practice these concepts tomorrow. 

### Day 8: July 7, 2020 
**Today's Progress**: I made progress with Flexbox and practiced its concepts with the online exercise (Flexbox Froggy), and by making custom navbars. 

**Thoughts:** Flexbox is very important to placing components on a page. I feel a little more confident in coding now!

### Day 9: July 8, 2020 
**Today's Progress**: I looked into designs for web developer portfolio pages. I began my own by writing the code for the header and the main quote on the page.  

**Thoughts:** It's a bit daunting taking on a whole website, but I enjoy coming up with color palettes and applying them to my site. Lots of work to do.

### Day 10-11: July 9-10, 2020 
**Today's Progress**: I spent these two days focusing on the box model, and Flexbox. 

**Thoughts:** This site it pretty simple so far, but it's helping me comprehend the basics better. I am shooting to have it finished by early next week.

### Day 12: July 11, 2020 
**Today's Progress**: Today I coded the bare bones for my 'About' section. 

**Thoughts:** So far I'm on schedule to finish on time. There will be lots of work to do tomorrow, but I'm optimistic. The things that take me the most time are deciding on design aspects throughout the site.

### Day 13: July 12, 2020 
**Today's Progress**: I styled the About section and updated the styling of a few other elements on the page to be more sleek.  

**Thoughts:** I like what I've made so far! My next big challenge will be styling the sticky header.

### Day 14: July 13, 2020 
**Today's Progress**: I had a bit of a setback today trying to get React projects to deploy on GitHub pages. I successfully deployed a simple project, but I expect more hiccups for the more complicated ones. I was trying to deploy these projects so that I could link to them from my portfolio site. 

**Thoughts:** I think I just need to familiarize myself more with the way React, uh, reacts...

### Day 15: July 14, 2020 
**Today's Progress**: I added the rest of the main sections of my portfolio site! 

**Thoughts:** Everything went pretty smooth today. I'm a little nervous about dealing with adjusting the site along with the size of the viewport, but I think I can handle it.

### Day 16: July 15, 2020 
**Today's Progress**: Today I learned more about margin and padding and how to apply it in the real world. 

**Thoughts:** Even though they are basic concepts, they can be diffucult for me to master. But I feel even more confident now, and am one step closer to using them to their full potential.

### Day 17: July 16, 2020 
**Today's Progress**: I refactored my code to be more dynamic using .map on an array that builds out the projects displayed in my portfolio. 

**Thoughts:** It took a lot of reading to learn how to make it work in React, but it was very satisfying seeing the proper results generated from the array.

### Day 18: July 17, 2020 
**Today's Progress**: Today I finished up the nav to jump to the proper section using a global function. This function includes the down arrow in the main page. 

**Thoughts:** I'm feeling more confident figuring things out when I don't know them. For example, I can make better educated guesses about syntax that I'm not sure of. Which is always a good feeling when I'm close, or get it right the first time.

### Day 19: July 18, 2020 
**Today's Progress**: I fixed a few bugs on my portfolio site and looked into different styles and methods of sticky headers that I will be implementing tomorrow.

### Day 20: July 19, 2020 
**Today's Progress**: I started and finished making my header transitions on scroll.

**Thoughts:** These transitions really bring the whole page together. I'm proud of my work.

### Day 21: August 9, 2020 
**Today's Progress**: I've been working with media queries the past few days to make my portfolio site responsive to large screens, small screens, and everything inbetween. 

**Thoughts:** I never realized just how much work went into making a site look good on every platform. But once you have all your bases covered, it's very satisfying.

### Day 22: August 10, 2020 
**Today's Progress**: Today I built out my mobile navigation. 

**Thoughts:** It was a good feeling seeing all my progress at the end of the day. I'm getting very close to finishing the site! I've done my best to stretch my abilities and do the most with this project, even though it's taken a litte longer than I first anticipated to finish, I think it's worth it.

### Day 23: August 11, 2020 
**Today's Progress**: Today I cleaned up yesterdays code and added a new feature that closes the mobile navigation when a click is registered outside of the div. 

**Thoughts:** I like how my code looks a lot better now. Looking at it again this morning, I realized I could write it more proficiently and cleaner. There is still one more bug I need to fix for this nav to be perfect, and I think I just have a misunderstanding in syntax that I will correct tomorrow.

### Day 23: August 12, 2020 
**Today's Progress**: I worked on fixing a few bugs with the nav today. There were three that I identified today and I only solved one. 

**Thoughts:** Today was a bit frustrating. I really wanted to solve all three of the bugs but I just kept running into dead ends. It's sometimes hard for me to put down the computer and take a break, but as much as I don't want to, I think it will benefit me more to have some break time between now and tomorrow morning.
